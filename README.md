Here I provided the Matlab implementation of FDS-MOMEDA. This is a practical application for extracting pulse components from vibration signals generated by faulty bearings using optimization algorithms in FDS (Finite Dimensional Space) and MOMEDA, which allows for the jitter of pulses (pseudo-periodicity). For the implementation of MOMEDA, please refer to (McDonald, G. L., & Zhao, Q. (2017). Multipoint optimal minimumentropy deconvolution and convolution fix: application to vibration fault detection. Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 82, 461-477.)

I kindly request any users to add full citation: Meng Zhang, FDS-MOMEDA: Optimization-Blind Deconvolution in Finite High-Dimensional Spaces for Extracting Pulse Signal in Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis, Measurement Science and Technology, 2024. (https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/ad4dcb)

I found out my code was being sold by some code sellesrs on the Internet. This is so not cool. At least buy me a coffee.
